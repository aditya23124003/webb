I have use HTML,CSS,Javascript,Bootstrap,API to create this website.
(
  known previously- HTML,CSS
  learned during this week -  Bootstrap ,Javascript,API data fetch
)
I have used OpenWeather API , which is one of the best Free API. 
there may be some data mismatch in temperature , but that is only due to wrong infomation being provided by the API.(I learned how to fetch Infomation from API and I have done it correctly)
